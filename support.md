# OWS Support Forum

The most easiest way is our new support forum. Visit [https://board.karakun.com](https://board.karakun.com) to access the forum.

<a href="https://board.karakun.com" target="_blank">![Support Forum](/assets/images/webstart/OWS-Board.png)</a>

The OpenWebStart Support Forum is available 24/7 and thus is the ideal platform for you to find answers to all OWS-related issues. With this board, you profit from a single point of contact to our support team as well as quick and straightforward help by the community. 

Besides all that, you will also find lots of interesting and useful announcements and posts, e.g. release notes, links to external resources, paid support options, etc.

# Community Support

The known communication channels ([GitHub Issues](https://github.com/karakun/OpenWebStart/issues) and [email](mailto:openwebstart@karakun.com)) will of course stay available and can be used to report bugs. But as we want to build up a knowledge base for the whole OWS community we will focus on answering questions in the forum.

# Paid Support Packages
Java and your operating system get updates, and so does OpenWebStart. Thanks to the support of our [awesome
sponsors](/sponsors), OpenWebStart will be updated and further developed as long as needed.

You can of course use <span class="text-highlight">Open<span>WebStart</span></span> as an open source solution free of charge but we‘d also like to talk to you about support options to guarantee the lasting development.
